Programming Assignment Description 1.pdf: This assignment is about applying data mining techniques on the UCI Machine Learning Repository dataset: Concrete Compressive Strength. The data showed 8 features with 1 response value (Concrete strength). 

The problem is finding the relation between these features contributing to the response value. We calculate 8 univariate models (i.e. each model with one column as input feature) and 1 multivariate model (i.e. one model with 8 columns as input features).
By using gradient descent as the algorithm with MSE as a loss function, we calculated the R squared value according to the training set and testing set. By doing so, we can understand how a single feature contributes to the resulting outcome of concrete strength.
